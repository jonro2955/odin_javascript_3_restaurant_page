# Restaurant Page

## [Live site](https://jonro2955.github.io/odin_javascript_3_restaurant_page/)

This is a mock restaurant website that is dynamically rendered using JavaScript and Webpack. Each part of the website are arranged into separate files such as the header.js, about.js (about page), menu.js (menu page), and so on. This mimics the kinds of app organization we use in React without using react.
